    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "How much does a state's social demographics influence how a state votes?  \n",
    " \n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "Understanding how the United States of America is governed is a complex problem. Simply described as a democracy where people vote for elected officials is an overgeneralization for the constitutional federal republic which is governed by three branches; executive, legislative and judicial. The judicial branch ensures that implemented laws are in accordance with the constitution that can be either places by the executive or legislative branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state has its own constitution and form of government that is also structured with executive, legislative and judicial branch. A republic is a form of government in which the people elect representatives. In the United States, people elect officials into the legislative branches based on popular vote. The Federal Executive branch which included the President and Vice President of the United States is elected by an electoral college. The electoral college mainly consists of two political parties; the Democratic and Republican Party\n",
    "\n",
    "The republic is not required to vote or align themselves to a political party. Therefore voter turnout is a dynamic variable and a state’s political majority can change at every election. To help understand how the United States is govern, we will study if social demographics have an influence on how people vote. Using Machine Learning Algorithms, we will create model to predict each state’s range of voter turnout and which party will be elected in federal elections.\n",
